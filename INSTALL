Currently there is only one binary, so installation is easy...
1)
	Install flex: 2.5.31 works, newer might be ok.

2)
	If you have absolutly no rights on the system:
		Run "sh localinstall.sh" as the user you want to develop under.
		This will use the first writeable PATH path as binary directory
		and install the configuration files to your home directory.

		Don't forget to awnser "yes" to the final do-you-really-want-this
		question.
		
	If you have some rights on the system and have aap (www.a-a-p.org):
		cd src
		aap install
	If you are an autotools fan, try
		./configure
		make
		sudo make install

3)
	For the user of ccbuild, it might be nice to add the standard unix
	headers as empty resolutions by copying the tools/ccResolutions.d
	directory to ~/.ccbuild (this is automatically done by the install
	script but not by the aap script.

If anything (or everything) failes mail me or try the manual way:

==Manually building and installing...
1) Build ccbuild
		Using make: type 'make -f Makefile.human'

2) Install
		Copy 'ccbuild' to any direcoty given by 'echo $PATH'

3) Default configuration (optional)
		You can copy the default configuration from the tools directory
		your local .ccbuild directory:
		mkdir ~/.ccbuild
		cp -r tools/ccResolutions.d ~/.ccbuild

4) Source code documentation (optional)
    Run doxygen in the root directory of ccbuild, this will generate
		documentation in the ./doc/html directory.

The test sources, usable for examples, are now seperately packaged.
If you want to try some examples, download the example codes from the
ccbuild homepage.
Also, don't forget to place any source you can find in a directory
 and run ccbuild, you never know, it might just compile!
See also "Projects using ccbuild" on the ccbuild homepage.
