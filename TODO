The features that may set of a new release and things to look out for:
  - Search for ccResolutions in higher directories
  - Add an interactive gui
  - Describe transition paths to various install/distribution systems (autotools, icmake, aap etc) in documentation
  - Add auditing command:
      Look for common problems, like including headers in both .hh and .ih of the same class.
      Look for inclusion of C headers instead of their C++ equivalent (limits.h instead of climits)
      Look for .ih headers depending on other .ih headers, which would cause awfull problems with the multi-threading
        part of the internal header precompilation.
  -  Write documentation on the ordering of library linking arguments.
      Showing that global header usage influences this and that it's
      a real problem with a solution in ccResolutions (force sequence
      by placing both libraries in both header resolution lines).
  -  Lib support in A-A-P and Makefiles.
  -  Take a look at source-header separation issue for library creation.
  ?? Time skew detection (warn when times are in the future/craeted time not updated)
  ?  Environment variables: CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CXX etc. Currently, most have
     already got program flags.
