The features that may set of a new release and things to look out for:
  - Describe transition paths to various install/distribution systems (autotools, icmake, aap etc) in documentation
  -  Write documentation on the ordering of library linking arguments.
      Showing that global header usage influences this and that it's
      a real problem with a solution in ccResolutions (force sequence
      by placing both libraries in both header resolution lines).
  -  Take a look at source-header separation issue for library creation.
