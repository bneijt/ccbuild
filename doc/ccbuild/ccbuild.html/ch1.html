Programming should not become an administrative task.  With most of the tools
on the net I found myself either adding file names to scripts (and removing
them) or digging deep into the core of some scripting language to try automate
my builds.  At first I ended up with a clumsy, to say the least, collection of
<samp>find</samp>, <samp>grep</samp>, <samp>sed</samp> and <samp>bash</samp>.
Combined they formed a script to generate Makefiles dispatched over multiple
directories.  The complexity quickly grew out of hand and it left me with a lot
of clutter around my source.  The second incarnation helped to generate
autotools scripts.  I had to run <samp>./configure</samp> to get the new
scripts to generate real Makefiles, followed by make.  If you commonly add and
remove files, updates are slow.
</p>

<p>
It was a depressing way to develop, because most additions to the project I
made required me to run all those scripts.  On top of that, it would take about
30 seconds, or so it felt.
</p>

<p>
You would say, well why not use an IDE?  Well, trouble here was I wanted to
split up my code in separate files...  a lot of separate files.  Not only do I
separate my code into directories, I also use seperate files for functions of
the same class.  No IDE allowed me to do this without the hassle of having to
go through a few menus (create file, register it as source, set is as part of
the main program, etc.).  Those who did, often used autotools in the background
and would have to re-autotool on every added file.  Frustrated, I almost gave
up on my coding ethics and started to do it the way the masses do: 900+ lines
of code in a single file, only accessible through a specially equipped text
editor or full scale IDE.
</p>

<p>
The closest thing to perfection out there was <code>icmake</code>.  This only
requires you to mention the directories you use and will keep your development
tree clean, however it had two small drawbacks: you needed to mention your
classes and you could not use directories in directories.  So, I decided to
create a fast and simple program to solve my problem.
</p>

<p>
Although you have to keep some standards (split source over directories) to get
<code>ccbuild</code> to work on your program, I found it almost completely
eliminated my interaction with the build system.  Better yet, it helps with
bootstrapping other build systems.
