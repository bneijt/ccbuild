<code>ccbuild</code> - A strict developer's build utility
<br>Chapter 4 - Moving to <code>ccbuild</code>
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
To be able to use <code>ccbuild</code>, you as a developer will have to adhere
to some strict(er) rules then using something like autotools.  Here is a list
of things you should keep in mind when moving to <code>ccbuild</code>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s4.1"></a>4.1 Strictness to adhere to</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>ccbuild</code> only reads local includes
</p>

<p>
When creating your source, make sure that all sources that <code>ccbuild</code>
should care about can be found using local includes.  This means you should
strictly use system wide includes only for actual system wide include files.
So any header file which is part or your packages should be included using a
local include statement.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Preprocessing isn't helping
</p>

<p>
To speed up <code>ccbuild</code>, it does not go around looking for system wide
headers.  This also means that it won't know all the preprocessing directives
from these headers.  This results in preprocessor excludes of local headers
cannot be used.  This is no problem if you are compiling for a single platform,
but when you need configuration using preprocessor directives, you're going to
get into trouble.
</p>

<p>
The only way to keep <code>ccbuild</code> from reading these sources is by
making sure there is a single space between the <samp>#</samp> and the
<samp>include</samp> statement.  So the include <samp># include
&quot;something/hello.hh&quot;</samp> will be ignored by <code>ccbuild</code>.
To test this, run <code>ccbuild</code> in verbose mode (<samp>--verbose</samp>)
and watch for the warning which state that the file in not included.  You can
also use the <samp>deps</samp> command to get a list for all binary targets.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="s4.2"></a>4.2 Setting up your configuration file</h2>

<p>
To set up your ccResolutions file, it's best to do the following steps:
</p>
<ol type="1" start="1" >
<li>
<p>
Check your local includes span over your whole source
</p>

<p>
To make sure <code>ccbuild</code> was able to follow your local includes, use
the <samp>deps</samp> command.  This will list all the local and global
dependencies of a file.  You may also use the dot command to get a graphical
interpretation of the same information.
</p>

<p>
All paths that <code>ccbuild</code> needs to search for local includes should
be added to the first line of your ccResolutions file.  Using <samp>-l</samp>
in this first line will make <code>ccbuild</code> highlight all compiler
output.
</p>

<pre>
     	#&amp; -I../tools -I. -l
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="2" >
<li>
<p>
Add packages to your global ccResolutions
</p>

<p>
You can add a package to your global resolution configuration using the
genPkgconfigList.sh tool.  This will find all files in the include path of a
package's include paths and add them to a resolution file.  See the Tools
section for more information.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1" start="3" >
<li>
<p>
Check the global includes are resolved
</p>

<p>
To make sure the global includes are resolved, use the resolve command.
</p>

<pre>
     	ccbuild resolve |sort &gt;&gt; ccResolutions
</pre>

<p>
Now all unresolved global headers are listed in your ccResolutions file.  When
you run <code>ccbuild</code> now, it won't complain about any global includes
missing.  However, g++ might complain because the needed extra arguments are
not in place.  You should now add the needed arguments to your ccResolutions
file by using, for example, <samp>`pkg-config --cflags --libs
&lt;packagename&gt;`</samp> with the needed package in place.
</p>

<p>
If you have a lot of resolution rules in your defaults
(<samp>~/.ccbuild/</samp>), then it might be hard to see what your project
actually depends on.  Passing <code>ccbuild</code> the option
<samp>--nodefres</samp> will cause it to skip loading these files and will
allow you to see which resolutions fail.  This might give you some hints on
what packages your program depends on.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
