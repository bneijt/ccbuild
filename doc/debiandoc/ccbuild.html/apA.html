<code>ccbuild</code> - A strict developer's build utility
<br>Appendix A - The tools directory</h1>

<hr>

<p>
The <samp>tools</samp> directory contains a few scripts and default files that
may come in handy.  These are not ment to be used allot and are mostly there to
inspire you to use <code>ccbuild</code> within other programs and build a
script around it.  These utilities are often crude and come with NO WARRENTY
WHATSOEVER.
</p>

<p>
Bottom line: read them before you use them and enjoy.

<h2><a name="sA.1"></a>A.1 genPkgconfigList.sh</h2>

<p>
This script will generate a list of includes that might be part of the given
package.  The scripts needs to get a valid package name as it's first argument.
It will then call pkg-config to get a list of include paths used for the
package.  All these paths are searched and all files found are linked to the
package using pkg-config in a way that is compatible with ccResolutions syntax.
</p>

<p>
This list will be very large, and it's not, generally, a good idea to add this
list to your local ccResolutions file.  A better way of using this is by adding
the file to your ccResolutions.d directory under the name of the package.
</p>

<p>
Using this is of course a brute way of handling resolutions, because it's much
nicer to only resolve the ones you need.

<h2><a name="sA.2"></a>A.2 ccbuildStatusPage.sh</h2>

<p>
This is a smaal ccbuild status page creation script.  All commandline arguments
you give it will be passed to ccbuild directly.  It runs &quot;ccbuild
check&quot; to check which files are up to date and which aren't.  Then using
AWK it translates this into a small auto-refreshing webpage.  The webpage uses
ccbuild.css as it's stylesheet.
</p>

<p>
General usage for a single run is:
</p>

<pre>
         sh ccbuildStatusPage.sh -C &quot;someproject/src&quot;
</pre>

<p>
Then use your favorite browser to open the generated html file:
ccbuildstatus.html.
</p>

<p>
You can easily loop it in the background using:
</p>

<pre>
         while [[ 1 ]];
           do sleep 5;
           nice sh ccbuildStatusPage.sh -C &quot;someproject/src&quot;;
         done;
</pre>

<p>
By default the up to date files aren't shown by using &quot;display: none&quot;
in the ccbuild.css.  Remove this line from ccbuild.css to show all up to date
files as well.
</p>
