<code>ccbuild</code> - A strict developer's build utility
<br>Chapter 1 - Introduction

<p>
First of all, programming is fun.  However, it should not become a
administrative task where you have to run update tools and add filenames to
scripts.  Apart from the possible typos, it's just no fun.
</p>

<p>
Using most of the tools on the net I found myself either adding filenames to
scripts (and removing them) or digging deep into the core of some weird
scripting language to try automate my builds.  I ended up with a clumsy, to say
the least, collection of <samp>find</samp>, <samp>grep</samp>, <samp>sed</samp>
and <samp>bash</samp>.  Then after having run my script generating script, I
had to run <samp>./configure</samp> to get the new scripts to generate real
Makefiles.  Then, the only thing left to do was to run <samp>make</samp>.
</p>

<p>
This was a depressing way to develop, because most additions to the project I
made required me to run all those scripts.  This would take about 30 seconds,
or so it felt.
</p>

<p>
You would say, well wy not use an IDE?  Well, trouble here was I wanted to
seperate my code...  allot.  Not only do I seperate my code into directories, I
also use seperate files for functions of the same class.  No IDE allowed me to
do this without the hassle of having to go through a few menus (create file,
regester it as source, set is as part of the main program, etc).
</p>

<p>
Frustrated, I almost gave up on my coding ethics and started to do it the way
the masses do: 900 lines of code in a single file, only accesible through a
specially equipped text editor or full scale IDE.  But then I found another
problem: I had to list the libraries I needed in some box somewhere!
<code>icmake</code> was one solution, however it had two small drawbacks:
object files weren't read for dependencies, you needed to mention your classes
and you couldn't use directories in directories.  So, I decided to create a
fast and simple program to solve my problem.
</p>

<p>
Although you have to keep some standards to get <code>ccbuild</code> to work on
your program, I found it made my programming fun again: write your program,
wait a few seconds for <code>ccbuild</code> to catch up and start testing!
